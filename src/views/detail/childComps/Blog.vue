        Life is a journey, and everyone is always a passerby. The mountains are green and the water is green. The passing of years, the passing of you and me. No one can stay, or leave anything. The years are in a hurry, and in the depths of the red dust, meeting is fate. do you know? Sometimes this fate comes from hardship, and often passes by. Many encounters and long-term companionships come from her own moral cultivation and self-cultivation, and she has won a respectful emotion and harmony with her inner soul. How many people can do: "Humanity is not only unconditional, but first love the most miserable and the least lovable person. Love from alienation to relatives, from far to near, through salvation and good deeds. Doing good to others is not Ask for compensation and be willing to suffer; when you are stimulated, you must be patient and forgive. Gentleness and humility. Jesus washed the feet of his disciples before his death, and Korean teachers washed the feet of students. These are all practices. "This state, this pattern? We practice in the same step as we do, and we are also practicing the deadliest and ruthlessness of our human weakness. Use your own value to reflect greater value.

        Time is beautiful and short. We are in this fleeting time, hurriedly, just breathing. Life is silent and dusty, you and I are overwhelmed by time. What else can you hate or care about? Sigh, life is so fragile, and the time we are together is not just a faint, but just a few days. Many people don't understand that even if they meet, it means they have not met. Because the inner and outer cultivation is different from the realm of thought, the three views are not in harmony, and over time they become strange to each other. This kind of getting along is very easy, the relaxed heart gradually let go of the burden in reality, together as clear and clear as pure water. No desire, no desire, looking straight at the purest world in my heart, staying together, is a lifetime of luck and happiness. The years are in a hurry, no one can live through the years, only live in the years vividly. Encountered in thousands of times on earth, and passed by. Each of them is a deep bond in the path of life. The fragrance of the years is overflowing, and the warmth when you and I are together. And some people see it right away, and it feels that way, just a glance, they have a kind of inescapable affection, and want to use what they have to protect, to care, to love her and him.

        Life is not in secrecy, but in silence, peace and a world of flowers, plants and trees. This grateful life journey has come all the way. The sun is shining brightly in our hearts. It's like a cup of tea, and those fragrances flow to life. The life like flowers and trees, accompanied us all the way, no matter the noise, peace, miserable defeat, prosperity. It is a flowing and vivid fragrance of life. The passing years are like water, and the life that is drifting away, looking back at the long and short memories that once had, and looking forward to tomorrow is the short and looking forward to tomorrow. At this moment, we looked at each other and smiled, clenching the hand of fate, it was endless warmth, not desolation, not pain. How short life is, how can we spend it with hatred and resentment? Let us be close to each other with grateful hearts in this moment of time, and let the flowers that grow along the way undefeated. This graceful journey of fragrance makes endless life alive and the loveliest dance in the soul. We embrace the years and live comfortably;

        You are my most affectionate scenery, let us enjoy the beauty of life in the dying world. This journey, all the scenery, are our warmest company. What we hold in our hands is between each other, the most peaceful and tender heart, the most grateful love, we respect life, respect each other, respect each day we live.
